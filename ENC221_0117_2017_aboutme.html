<h1 style="font-size:200%;color:green;"><b>High Spatial Resolution Soil Organic Carbon Assessment in Cropland Area</b></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><b>Case study: Moiben Sub-County</b></h2>

<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b><p>
<p>Soil organic carbon constitutes an important indicator of soil fertility. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is related to soil biological, physical, and chemical properties and constitutes a major component of the global carbon cycle(Bangelesa et al., 2020). About 75% of total carbonic stock of terrestrial ecosystem is estimated to lie in soil and forms the most important parameter for examining soil quality and health(Kumar et al., 2018). 
Continued alteration and changes in land-use practices has had adverse effects on the soil, such as degradation and erosion due to land clearing and cultivation. Pressure on soils continually increase due to the agricultural intensification in order to meet the food demand to sustain the ever growing population(Delgado-baquerizo et al., 2017). SOC helps in reducing the mass, toxicity, mobility and concentration of pollutants through physical, chemical and biological processes. Determination of SOC is thus key in soil health monitoring and overall environmental management.

SOC content was initially measured based on the laboratory analysis of field soil samples, which are discrete and incapable of providing continuous information about the entire study area and require extensive time and labor. Hence the spatial variability of SOC through field cannot be determined.

To capture and quantify SOC contents in agricultural soils for efficient and sustainable
land use, data with high spatial resolution is needed in order to understand the impacts
of climate change on soil quality(Zepp et al., 2021)

<p><b><u>PROBLEM STATEMENT.</u></b></p>
<p>•    Precision agriculture is important for food security, use of improved inputs, seeds and technological advancement is not enough. Monitoring and mapping of soil organic carbon variations is key for understanding effects of agricultural practices on SOC which directly influences the general productivity of the land.</br>
•   Understanding the relationship of the soil organic carbon and the soil moisture plays a significant role in agricultural management especially with the current climate trends.</br>
•   Use of field sampling techniques for soil organic carbon determination is tiresome, expensive, time consuming and biased(Castaldi et al., 2019), thus determination of spatial variability of SOC through field cannot be achieved.
